# Native (Rasterized)

The Rasteizer [`Frontend`](../../about/concepts.md#frontend-trait) enables building native applications that use a [`Renderer`](https://gooey.rs/main/gooey/core/renderer/trait.Renderer.html) implementation.

Widgets are drawn using primitive drawing calls in this frontend.

TODO More Coming soon. Revisit after adding more built-in documentation to the rasterizer crate.
