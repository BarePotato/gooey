# Gooey User's Guide

Gooey is a Graphical User Interface library written in Rust. At its core, it attempts to provide a framework that allows building truly cross-platform applications.

This user's guide aims to provide a guided walkthrough for users to understand how Gooey works. This guide is meant to be supplemental [to the documentation](https://gooey.rs/main/gooey/). If you learn best by exploring examples, [our primary collection is available in `gooey/examples`](https://github.com/khonsulabs/gooey/blob/main/gooey/examples). If, however, you learn best by taking a guided tour of how something works, this guide is specifically for you.

If you have any feedback on this guide, please [file an issue](https://github.com/khonsulabs/gooey/issues), and we will try to address any issues or shortcomings.

Thank you for exploring Gooey.
